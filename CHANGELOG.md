# Changelog

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-08

### Added

- **Browser dashboard** (`GET /ns/:token`) — live HTML UI for each namespace. Lists all devices, opens a WebSocket per device, and renders `in`/`out` controls defined by device logic in real time.
- Shared layout (`views/layouts/default.html.tmpl`) used by both the namespace index and dashboard views.
- `namespaces#show` controller action and `show_namespace` route.
- Tests for `GET /ns/:token` (200 HTML, device cards present) and 404 for unknown token.
- Root index now links to the dashboard instead of the raw JSON devices endpoint.

### Fixed

- `docs/mojo-way.md` content block syntax: `<{block}>` (no spaces) is the correct mojo.js form; the spaced variant `<{ block }>` is silently ignored by the template engine.
